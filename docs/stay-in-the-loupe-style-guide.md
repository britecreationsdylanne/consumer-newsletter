## Section-by-Section Guidelines

### 1. Intro Bubble

**Purpose:** Set the tone, provide seasonal context, preview what's inside

**Style notes:**
- Start with a seasonal/timely greeting
- Preview 2-3 key topics in the issue
- Include a soft CTA when relevant (e.g., fill out a form, check something out)
- Keep it conversational and brief (3-4 sentences)

**Examples:**
> "Happy New Year! We hope 2026 is off to a strong start, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with you in the months ahead. In this issue, we look back at our year in review, highlighting three key opportunities to take advantage of right now, including new appraisal designs, POS integrations, and a call for experts."

> "From all of us at BriteCo, we are wishing you a very happy holiday season! In addition to our tips below for more referral opportunities, we also wanted to remind you that we are looking for experts for our blog and YouTube channel."

**Key patterns:**
- "In this issue, we [verb]..."
- "We hope [seasonal sentiment]..."
- "In addition to [main content], we also wanted to remind you..."

---

### 2. The Good, Bad, and the Ugly

**Purpose:** Three short, categorized news stories that entertain while informing

**Style notes:**
- **Good:** Positive, heartwarming, or impressive jewelry news
- **Bad:** Cautionary tales, legal issues, or unfortunate incidents (keep it light)
- **Ugly:** Quirky, bizarre, or aesthetically unusual jewelry stories

Each item has:
1. A short, punchy **headline** (2-6 words, often a pun or wordplay)
2. A **one-paragraph description** (2-3 sentences max)

**Format:**
> **Good:**
> **[Clever Headline]**
> [Brief description of the story with relevant details]

**Example headlines with wordplay:**
- "Make Jewelry, Not War" (about Ukrainian jeweler)
- "Bad Egg" (about someone swallowing jewelry)
- "Not Above the Law" (about legal issues)
- "LA Strong" (about LA wildfire charity)
- "Gone Rotten" (about decay-themed jewelry art)
- "Holiday Faux Pas" (about ugly Christmas sweater jewelry)

**Tone guidance:**
- **Good:** Genuinely positive, can be inspirational or impressive
- **Bad:** Slightly sardonic, raise-an-eyebrow tone, but never mean-spirited
- **Ugly:** Playful, amused, "you have to see this" energy

**Example - Good:**
> **LA Strong**
> A year after the devastating wildfires in California, actress Olivia Wilde and Starling Jewelry have designed a charitable 14k gold pendant to give back to the community.

**Example - Bad:**
> **Bad Egg**
> A 32-year-old New Zealand man pleaded not guilty to swallowing a Faberge pendant necklace and chain, although that claim is likely going to be just as rough to pass.

**Example - Ugly:**
> **Gone Rotten**
> Gemstones may not expire, but artist Kathleen Ryan still found a way to make lapis lazuli, malachite, and turquoise look like mold in her rotting raspberry sculpture.
